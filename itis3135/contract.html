    <h2>Course Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, <strong>Nebiyu Tegegne</strong> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
      <strong>Fall 2025, ITIS 3135, Front-End Web App Development</strong> with my instructor, 
      <strong>Professor D.I. von Briesen</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available 
      to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that 
      I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not 
      logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many 
      examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these 
      resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
      (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
