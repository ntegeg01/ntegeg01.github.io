    <h2>About Notable Tiger</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Notable Tiger</strong> started with a simple idea:  
      what if stationery could be as bold and unforgettable as a tiger?  
      Instead of dull notebooks and plain pens, we bring stripes, paws, and personality to every product.

      Our goal is to help students, writers, and dreamers make their mark in the world.  
      Each piece of our collection is a reminder that your words matter,  
      and that even the smallest note can leave a big impression — just like the mighty tiger.
